                " Many curry powder recipes call for cayenne powder, which contains capsaicin and can be quite fiery. According to Kang and Kole, cayenne has a Scoville rating between 30,000 and 50,000, which means it quite a bit spicier than jalapeno and Serrano peppers. Other ingredients, including paprika and dried mustard, can add a tiny amount of spice",
